                            <h2>About Us</h2>
                            Owning and operating a shoe store may seem the ideal goal for anyone passionate about footwear. But business savvy is a must, as retail success is ultimately about the numbers--sales numbers. This means the store design, the stock and even the lighting must appeal to the target consumer. Whether you plan to cater to economy-minded families or upscale patrons focused on the height of luxury, your shoe store must meet consumer needs and expectations.
                            Inviting Exterior
First impressions are critical to any retail establishment. Exterior design, signage and logo should appeal to your target consumer. In a store that specializes in a certain type of footwear--designer, athletic or comfort/walking--exterior elements should also convey the spirit of the store's inventory, so consumers unfamiliar with the retailer get an immediate impression of what the store has to offer.


Display Window Design
Though the display window is viewed from the store exterior, it deserves its own section. Display designs can be used to convey store branding, highlight manufacturer/designer names or alert potential customers to special pricing or promotions. Any shoes on display should be adequately spaced and arranged in a way that complements attendant signage. The plate glass itself should be spotless. Cramped, crowded displays and dirty windows are an immediate consumer turnoff.

Inventory
A system to keep careful track of which brands and styles of shoes sell best is essential. Take advantage of stock keeping units (SKUs), stock aging codes to get a grasp of inventory levels and when to reorder. Items that do not move well can be reduced in inventory or eliminated altogether.

Quality Staff/Customer Service
Staffers who know footwear, know your store stock and understand your core consumer are invaluable to the success of your establishment. Look for experienced shoe sellers, preferably with expertise or strong interest in your store's specialty category, such as women's casual or dressy designs. Floor staff with a genuine interest in both customer and product help make consumers feel secure. The ability to up-sell to an individual or family is also important.

Product Selection
A family-oriented store is well-advised to keep on hand shoes to appeal to everyone, from fashion-oriented teens to comfort-oriented 30- and 40-somethings. Limited selection can encourage customers to shop elsewhere. Even if your store offers and item for one family member, the family might prefer to make their purchases at a store that can fulfill everyone's needs.

In-Store Displays
In-store displays can be as important as attractive window displays. Highlight the newest designs and special pricing by elevating the display or placing them near the store entrance. Even the clearance area should be tidy and well sorted by size and, hopefully, style.

Ample Seating
Once a customer expresses interest in a style, she will want to try some on. If the shopper cannot find a comfortable place to sit to fit the shoe, she may give up and leave the store in frustration. In addition, comfortable seating helps customers feel welcome and will always be appreciated by the shopper's disinterested spouse.

Good Lighting
Lighting both window and interior displays is important. But good lighting design can also contribute to a warm, welcoming ambiance. The luxury retailer may choose to wash the space in subdued rosy or golden light, while the family store might stick to cheerful, practical bright white lighting. Featured items may be spotlighted from the ceiling or lit from below to distinguish them from other displays.

Plenty of Mirrors
All the comfy seating in the world will be of no use if the shopper cannot view a tried-on shoe in an appropriately located mirror. Use a mix of full-length and knee-length mirrors, so consumers can view both the small and big picture. Luxury consumers may want to match the shoe to a purse or handbag, making the full-length mirror a must. Wedding and other special-occasion consumers have been known to wear special-event clothing to a store to help in shoe selection. If your store is a high-volume establishment, place as many mirrors as practical throughout the space.

Brand Image
According to Power Home Biz, a strong brand is critical to shoe store success. Think clearly and carefully about who your target market is and what you want the store to represent. You may enjoy catering to fashionistas with deep pockets who crave only the latest European styles. Or you might craft the store image to suit the tastes and budgets of middle-class families. An athletic shoe store may be closely affiliated in shoppers' minds with the most popular sports brands. A walking shoe store may want to promote not specific brands but the notion that comfort takes precedence over style or hype.
